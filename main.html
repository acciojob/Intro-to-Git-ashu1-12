	<p>My introduction to Git and Google Colab was both exciting and insightful. Git helped me understand version control and how developers collaborate efficiently using platforms like GitHub. On the other hand, Colab made it easy to run Python code in the cloud without any setup, especially for data science projects. Together, they opened the door to more organized and collaborative coding practices.
